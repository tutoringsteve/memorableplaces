# memorableplaces
A simple Android app for saving a list of memorable places on the Google map.

After compiling the app, click the top option on the list to open the map to your present location. Long press a spot on the map to leave a marker. Hit the back button to return to the list of markers, sorted by order added, and named by address. A save option allows you to save the list for a different session, and the load button allows you to load that saved session.
